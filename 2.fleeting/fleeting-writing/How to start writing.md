# How to start writing
Most writing advice is simple.

==Use stories to illuminate what you’re trying to say. Write in short sentences. Make one point per sentence.== Communicate with a smooth and natural tone, as if you’re talking to a friend at a bar. If you have writer’s block, you don’t have enough notes, so rather than starting with a blank page, start with an abundance of notes. There you go. That’s just about all you need to start writing well.

==Don’t just [[写作是什么|write for yourself]]. Share your ideas by publishing them online.== Writing in public is like inviting guests to your house for dinner. You have to clean and double check everything. Just like when you cook a meal for your guests, you try harder when others are watching and your reputation is at stake.
