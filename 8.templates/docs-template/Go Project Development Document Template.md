## Code Convention

In this section, we detail the coding standards and conventions for our project. Adhering to these conventions helps maintain code consistency and readability and facilitates collaboration among team members.

### Code Style

- **Formatting**: All code must be formatted with the `gofmt` tool to ensure it adheres to Go's standard formatting.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variable names should be short yet meaningful, preferring full words over abbreviations (except for well-established abbreviations like `ID` instead of `Id`).
  - Function names should use CamelCase and accurately describe the function's purpose.
  - Constants should be in uppercase with words separated by underscores.
  - Type names should follow the CamelCase convention and be short, meaningful, and descriptive.

### Comments

- Use `//` for single-line comments, placed before or at the end of a line for clarification.
- Complicated logic or blocks of code must include detailed comments explaining how they work.
- Public functions/methods must be fully documented, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any errors they might return.
- Use `godoc`-style comments to facilitate automatic API documentation generation.

### Error Handling

- Never ignore errors. All errors must be handled appropriately.
- Handle errors as early as possible to prevent error propagation.
- Where possible, provide helpful error messages rather than merely returning the error.

### Concurrency

- When using Go concurrency primitives (such as goroutines and channels), be mindful of avoiding race conditions.
- Synchronize access to shared resources using synchronization primitives from the `sync` package, like `sync.Mutex`.

### Code Organization

- Group related functionalities within the same package. If a package grows too large, consider splitting it logically.
- Avoid nesting packages too deeply; try to keep the package hierarchy straightforward.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for the main functionalities to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Use Go’s `testing` package for writing tests and adhere to the Table-Driven Tests pattern.
- The code in tests should also follow the same conventions.

Adherence to the above conventions is essential for maintaining the overall quality and consistency of the project. Team members should periodically review these guidelines and make appropriate adjustments as the project evolves.

## Quick Start

Include steps for installing, configuring, and running the project.

```sh
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/example/project.git

# Enter the project directory
cd project

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Start the project
go run cmd/main.go
```

## Functional Modules

Detail the main functional modules and features of the project.

## API Documentation

If the project provides API interfaces, provide links to Swagger or other documentation here, or describe the API interfaces in detail.

## Performance Tests

Provide the results and analysis of performance tests.

## Problems and Solutions

Record the main problems encountered during the development process and their solutions.

## Version Control

Describe the project's version management strategy.

## Team Members

List the members of the project team and their roles.

## References

List reference links.
